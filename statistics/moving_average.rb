      You may think of it as "how well the given person has been doing recently".
      This computes exponentially moving average (EMA) of competitor averages.
      EMA is a weighted average, with weights decreasing exponentially,
      meaning that more recent values contribute more to the computed average.
      Here we use Î± = 0.95, meaning that we average over ~20 last values
      (i.e. older values are pretty much ignored).
